 This is "fall 1400 - Deep Learning course" project. It will take a photo in its input and will give you the result which is the same photo with bounding boxes around the objects. For each of those bounding boxes, there will be a lable of what category that object belongs to? with what confidency? and how far that object is from the photographer? In scale of 0 to 1 [ 0: so close - 1: far far away]
